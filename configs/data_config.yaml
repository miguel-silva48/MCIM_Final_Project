# Data Configuration for Medical Image Captioning Project

# Projection strategy for training
# Options: 'first_frontal', 'paired', 'all'
# - first_frontal: Use only the first frontal image per patient (recommended for patient-level splitting)
# - paired: Use only patients with exactly 1 frontal + 1 lateral image
# - all: Use all images (may cause data leakage if same patient in train/val)
projection_strategy: 'first_frontal'

# Text source for caption generation
# Options: 'findings', 'impression', 'both'
# - findings: Detailed observations from the radiologist
# - impression: Concise clinical conclusion (recommended as target)
# - both: Concatenate findings and impression
text_source: 'impression'

# Maximum allowed ratio of censored tokens (XXXX) in reports
# Reports with higher censoring will be filtered out
# Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., 0.3 = 30% XXXX tokens allowed)
max_censoring_ratio: 0.3

# Minimum frequency for a token to be included in vocabulary
# Lower values = larger vocabulary, higher values = smaller vocabulary
# Recommended values: 3-5 for medical domain
min_vocab_freq: 5

# Text preprocessing options
text_preprocessing:
  lowercase: true
  remove_punctuation: true   # Remove punctuation for cleaner n-grams and vocabulary
  clean_metadata: true       # Remove age, exam type, etc.

# Data splits (percentages)
splits:
  train: 0.80
  val: 0.10
  test: 0.10

# Random seed for reproducibility
random_seed: 42
